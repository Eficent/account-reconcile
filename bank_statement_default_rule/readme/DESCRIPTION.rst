This module allows users to propose default values in bank statement lines
based on regex rules applicable to existing content in the statement line.

For example, if the label of the statement contains "FACEBK", then apply
the partner "Facebook, Inc.".

The user is given the option to apply the defaults, but the rules could also
be triggered by modules that automatically import the bank statement.

The user can also create new rules from the statement screen.
