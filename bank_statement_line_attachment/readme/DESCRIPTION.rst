This module allows to add attachments to bank statement lines, if it has
been deemed as necessary.

It is common that some of the bank statement lines will be reconciled to
an expense account during the reconciliation process. That could be more
convenient to the company than having to enter invoices or vouchers. In that
scenario there's currently no place to store an evidence of the physical
receipts associated to that expense.
